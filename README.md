# WoC6.0-DL-name-generation-model-jatan_sahu
 Winter of Code 6.0 challenge: this repository houses a name generation model using advanced deep learning techniques for creating unique and customizable names.


 
# Overview:

In this project, we will learn how to create a name generation model using both LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks. The project involves training these networks on a dataset of names to learn patterns and generate new, unique names. This hands-on experience offers insights into recurrent neural network architectures, data preprocessing for natural language processing, and the intricacies of model training and evaluation.


# Why (this project/this technology)?:
